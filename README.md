📌 Project Overview

This project aims to provide a centralized DevSecOps metrics dashboard that consolidates performance, build, and security insights from multiple tools into a single view.
It helps executives monitor software delivery efficiency, security posture, and overall DevSecOps health in real time.

Unlike traditional methods that analyze data separately from CI/CD and security scanners, this system integrates Jenkins, Docker, Prometheus, and Grafana to automate metric collection and visualization.

🎯 Objectives

Integrate DevOps and Security (DevSecOps) practices seamlessly.

Automate data collection from Jenkins pipelines and monitoring tools.

Provide a visual, real-time dashboard using Grafana and Prometheus.

Empower teams with actionable insights on deployment and vulnerability trends.

🏗️ System Architecture

Here’s the overall workflow of the system:

Code Commit: Developers push code to GitHub.

CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins): Two pipelines — Python and Build-Metrics — automate build, test, and deployment stages.

Containerization (Docker): Applications run inside Docker containers for consistency.

Monitoring (Prometheus): Collects and stores performance and build metrics.

Visualization (Grafana): Displays metrics on real-time dashboards for executive insights.

Grafana	Visualization and dashboard analytics
GitHub	Version control and collaboration
Python	Sample application and scripts


🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/varshinireddy864/job-dshboard.git


Open Jenkins and create two pipelines:

Python – for sample code testing

Build-Metrics – for metric extraction and build tracking

Use Docker to build and run the containers:

docker build -t devsecops-dashboard .
docker run -p 9090:9090 devsecops-dashboard


Start Prometheus and Grafana using Docker or your local setup.

Open Grafana (default: http://localhost:3000
) and import the dashboard JSON to view metrics.

📊 Output

Real-time dashboard displaying:

Deployment frequency

Build success/failure rates

Vulnerability and performance metrics

Compliance trends
